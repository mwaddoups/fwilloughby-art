Chance and a playful sense of curiosity guide the creation of these images alluding to a sequence of long-forgotten daydreams. Willoughby is interested in how images represent memories and how memories have the habit of changing and breaking down. These new images of strangers allow the possibility of new narratives to be woven into them. Many of the images from this body of work focus on portrait photography and masking the identities of those who feature in them. The photos are partially obscured from view to represent the unreliable and ever-changing nature of memories.
