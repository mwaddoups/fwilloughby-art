description: 'Rupture (2017) was an installation on display at Showroom 1600 in Bournemouth,
  UK. Rupture represents the feeling of trauma when beginning cycles of change. The
  stress of this transition is visualised by the two bodies, which are being ripped
  apart by the pressure placed on the stitching. The stones fall gradually from the
  base of the bodies into an enamel bowl symbolising pieces of anxiety being relinquished.
  Willoughby has created something that demonstrates this tension – the sculptural
  bodies had become structurally integral to the room it was displayed in – as if
  by removing them the walls would simply fall in. '
