description: "‘Bad Breast’ draws on Melanie Klein’s (b.1882-1960) theories on the
  psychoanalysis of children. In object relations theory, the paranoid-schizoid position
  is where the mother is not a mother to the child merely a pair of breasts, which
  will appear and disappear with randomness. This causes the infant both intense pleasure
  and great distress, causing the infant to split the mother into the good breast
  and the bad breast.  "
