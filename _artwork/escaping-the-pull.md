description: Catastrophic thinking is a behaviour I find myself doing more often than
  I would like to admit. It is a habit I subconsciously slip into and pull away from,
  especially now, when there is so much time to contemplate. As the anxiety rises,
  my insides become entangled, until I recollect my thoughts and reconsider the likelihood
  of this idea becoming reality.
