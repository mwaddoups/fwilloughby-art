description: 'Found photographs provoke unanswerable questions. These strangers represent
  faded memories, an anonymous snapshot into another reality. Undefined and malleable
  their past unknown, they enable new narratives to be woven. These images have become
  an inexplicit memorial, conveying a sense of fragmentation and loss. '
