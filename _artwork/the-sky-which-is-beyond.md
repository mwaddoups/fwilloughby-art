description: >-
  The Sky Which Is Beyond exhibited at Bricks, St Annes House, Bristol (2022) A
  black rectangular frame sits within the glass vitrine, small stones fill the
  base of the receptacle. Within this space three objects â€“ a mannequin hand, a
  taxidermy bird and a conch shell are suspended in red semi-transparent vinyl
  compartments. 
   
  The assemblage signifies the archive as a repository of memory, unstable and
  partial. It is an exploration into the counter-archive where the objects are
  fragments of a dreamscape, preserved, arranged, and classified. It comments on
  the narrative of individual memory and the role it plays in the visual
  recording of our collective histories. The objects which originate from the
  artist's personal collection, have been recontextualised into a souvenir of
  reverie. 


  Taxonomy and Victorian taxidermy displays influence the visual aesthetic. The
  Sky Which Is Beyond draws on the rich history of the Wunderkammer or a cabinet
  of curiosities that typically stored collections of unusual objects and
  artefacts.
