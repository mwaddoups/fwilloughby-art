description: "The Sky Which Is Beyond exhibited Bricks, St Annes House, Bristol (2022)
  A black rectangular frame sits within the glass vitrine, small stones fill the base
  of the receptacle. Within this space three objects – a mannequin hand, a taxidermy
  bird and a conch shell are suspended in red semi-transparent vinyl compartments.
  \n \nThe assemblage signifies the archive as a repository of memory, unstable and
  partial. It is an exploration into the counter-archive where the objects are fragments
  of a dreamscape, preserved, arranged, and classified. It comments on the narrative
  of individual memory and the role it plays in the visual recording of our collective
  histories. The objects which originate from the artist's personal collection, have
  been recontextualised into a souvenir of reverie. \n\nTaxonomy and Victorian taxidermy
  displays influence the visual aesthetic. The Sky Which Is Beyond draws on the rich
  history of the Wunderkammer or a cabinet of curiosities that typically stored collections
  of unusual objects and artefacts.  "
