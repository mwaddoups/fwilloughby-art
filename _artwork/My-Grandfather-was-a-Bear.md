description: >-
  My Grandfather Was a Bear (2023) is a sculpture which sits prominently at the
  centre of the Telling Tales. Emerging from the bear's jaws is a cast of her
  grandfather's head, weaving a powerful narrative of familial connections. This
  evocative piece seamlessly merges the ancestral and the animalistic, inviting
  contemplation on identity, myth, and the enduring legacy of family.
