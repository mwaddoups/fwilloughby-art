description: >-
  The Gaze is an interactive sculpture centring around a large photograph of my
  eye. One side is open, the other closed; a handle invites viewers to spin the
  structure, creating a blinking effect. This work explores the illusion of
  linear time, referencing the cyclical motions of clocks, planets, and
  processing algorithms. The blinking eye, both observer and observed, evokes
  questions around surveillance, agency, and the politics of the gazeâ€”especially
  through a feminist lens. It asks: How do we perceive time? Who controls what
  we see? And how do we reclaim vision in a world increasingly mediated by
  technology?
