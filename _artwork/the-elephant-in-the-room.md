description: 'The Elephant in the Room (2016) was part of an exhibition titled SÉANCE
  : A Family Collection Revisited in collaboration with Russell Cotes Museum in Bournemouth,
  UK. This installation featured a full size cast of the artist’s body under a tablecloth
  in the centre of the museum''s dining room. There is an element of humour in the
  work; the haunted house aesthetic of the museum is evident. The body referenced
  the unpublicised, lesser-known history of the Russel Cotes family which included
  shady politics, questionable financial dealings and angry mobs burning effigies.
  It also comments on the instabilities of the Russell-Cotes family and the legacy
  they left behind.
