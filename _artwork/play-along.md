description: "Play Along (2017) exhibited at Free Range, London, UK and The Mall,
  London, UK.\nPlay Along evokes a stage set referencing a domestic living space with
  distinct differences. Wood chips cover the floor,  fig trees line the edge of the
  work and several bodies emerge from the furniture which occupies the space to explore
  the polarity of order and chaos, domestic and wild, and personal and public. The
  installation acts as a snapshot into the immediate aftermath of experiencing the
  unexpected loss of a loved one. The contorted bodies - modelled after the artist's
  own body - represent different emotional states she experienced: confusion, anger
  and sadness. "
