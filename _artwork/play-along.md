description: The fragmented body can transform an everyday object into something subversive and uncanny.
  This space is my stage set, a freeze frame of a narrative I have experienced.
  Conflict, drama and loss all of which I analyse and pick apart.
  These enlarged dolls are my playthings, my puppets, each playing their part in re-enacting my memories.
