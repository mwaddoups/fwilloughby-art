Installation  
Mixed media  
2017

The fragmented body can transform an everyday object into something subversive and uncanny.
This space is my stage set, a freeze frame of a narrative I have experienced.
Conflict, drama and loss all of which I analyse and pick apart.
These enlarged dolls are my playthings, my puppets, each playing their part in re-enacting my memories.
